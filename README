HaoQi's Barnacle Fork
==================
Goal: modify Barnacle to put the phone wifi into adhoc mode without
the NAT or DHCP binaries running, and simplify the interface.

Step 1. The wifiState can get to == WifiManager.WIFI_STATE_DISBALED

Step 2. Changed. Delete checkUplink(), don't need ConnectivityManager.TYPE_MOBILE or TYPE_WIMAX for 3G connections

Barnacle Wifi Tether
====================

Barnacle is a combination of tools to provide wifi tethering 
on an Android phone:
 * NAT
 * DHCP server
 * WLAN ad-hoc setup
