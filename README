HaoQi's Barnacle Fork
==================
Goal: 
1. modify Barnacle to put the phone wifi into adhoc mode without
the NAT or DHCP binaries running, and simplify the interface.

-Phone can ping connected laptop and vice versa, but connected devices don't show up in the "clients" tab
- Have to change the connected laptop's network configuration to be in the same DHCP area 

Goal:
2. Simplifiy the phone IP address change process. 

currently the steps are: Barnacle -> Settings -> DHCP -> Gateway -> Okay

Barnacle Wifi Tether
====================

Barnacle is a combination of tools to provide wifi tethering 
on an Android phone:
 * NAT
 * DHCP server
 * WLAN ad-hoc setup

To build the Android app import the existing project into Eclipse and export
